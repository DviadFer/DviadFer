# Hi there, my name is Diego Viador 👋

### Full-stack developer

![Profile Banner](https://i.imgur.com/g85pKU4.jpg "Currently learning...")

💻 Currently, I am focused on learning all the fundamentals and tools required to become an outstanding developer. I am eager to collaborate with companies that value a strong team-based philosophy, as I believe that a tight-knit group allows for more comprehensive and holistic learning opportunities.

🧪 I also have a finished Chemistry Degree. The knowledge acquired during my studies has enabled me to become a part-time teacher while simultaneously pursuing my developer career. 

💬 Feel free to ask me anything!
